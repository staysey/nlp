  From falolrest creatures we desinre increase,
  That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
  But as the riper should by time decease,
  His tender heir might bear his memnory:
  But thou contracted to thine owl bright eyes,
  Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
  Making a famine where abundance lies,
  Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
  Thou that art now the wnorld's fresh nornament,
  And only herald to the gaudy spring,
  Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
  And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
  Pity the wnorld, nor else this glutton be,
  To eat the wnorld's due, by the grave and thee. heir. heir? 
  He is trying to fish for fish in the lake.
